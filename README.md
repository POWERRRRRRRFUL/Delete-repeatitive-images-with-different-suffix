# Delete-repeatitive-images-with-different-suffix
Discription:
  
This brief programme is used to delete excessive images that have been stored in .raw and .jpg and only keep .raw. 
  (sometimes, you wish to maximise the storage)
  
Notice:

  My camera is a Fujifilm XT-4 so the ".raw" was converted into ".raf".
  You can adjust the name to your camera. 
  
  Here are the RAW file formats for different camera brands:
  
    1. Canon: .CR2 (for newer models) or .CR3 (for the latest models)
    2. Nikon: .NEF
    3. Sony: .ARW
    4. Fujifilm: .RAF
    5. Olympus: .ORF
    6. Panasonic: .RW2
    7. Pentax: .PEF
    
  It's worth noting that each brand might have various models and different RAW file formats, so there can be some variations at times.
